<h6 class=" text-center">Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. Water saturation (hydrology) largely determines how the soil develops and the types of plant and animal communities living in and on the soil. Wetlands may support both aquatic and terrestrial species. The prolonged presence of water creates conditions that favor the growth of specially adapted plants (hydrophytes) and promote the development of characteristic wetland (hydric) soils.</h6>

        <h4>Coastal/Tidal Wetlands</h4>
        <p><img src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2021/07/10143131/shutterstock_15172081132-960x640.jpg" alt="" width="400"></p>
        <p>Coastal/tidal wetlands in the United States, as their name suggests, are found along the Atlantic, Pacific, Alaskan and Gulf coasts. They are closely linked to our nation's estuaries where sea water mixes with fresh water to form an environment of varying salinities. The salt water and the fluctuating water levels (due to tidal action) combine to create a rather difficult environment for most plants. </p>

        <h4>Inland/Non-tidal Wetlands</h4>
        <p><img src="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/wetlands/images/LIVE-BLUE-10.png" alt="" width="370"></p>
        <p>Inland/non-tidal wetlands are most common on floodplains along rivers and streams (riparian wetlands), in isolated depressions surrounded by dry land (for example, playas, basins and "potholes"), along the margins of lakes and ponds, and in other low-lying areas where the groundwater intercepts the soil surface or where precipitation sufficiently saturates the soil (vernal pools and bogs). </p>
